# News Explorer

## Overview
News Explorer is a React-based web application designed to provide users with a platform to search for news articles using keywords and save their favorite articles for future reference. Leveraging a third-party API, News Explorer enables users to explore a vast array of news articles based on their interests. This repository serves as the frontend of the project. Upon completion of the backend, users will be able to sign up and log in with user authentication, allowing them to save articles to their own accounts to be accessed anytime. For now, users can temporarily "sign in" and save articles, but they will disappear once the session ends.

### Features
- Keyword Search: Utilize the search functionality to discover news articles related to specific keywords or topics.
- Save Articles: Once logged in, users can save their favorite articles and view them on their personal saved news page.
- Responsive Design: News Explorer is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The application's adaptive design provides a seamless user experience, regardless of the device's screen size or orientation.
